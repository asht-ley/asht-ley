### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working being a self-taught front end software engineer. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning CS50x and other resources within a goal of 4 to 6 months of finishing it. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on my first freelance work this upcoming year 2022. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning more, meeting new people and getting the hang of the tech world.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything and I would be delighted to interact with you! 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach me @ my email: ashtleysilassandoval@gmail.com 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am still 18 years old but already thinks like a tech-savvy woman developer/ softwer engineer. I don't see my age as an opportunity to grow and experience things more. I love to keep learning and having fun!
